The problem is about processing queries on a specific type of string called a "10-string." A 10-string is a string that starts with '1' and ends with '0' and only contains the characters '1' and '0'. For example, "10101010", "100", and "1010" are 10-strings.

The goal is to convert a given 10-string, S, into another 10-string, U, by flipping some of its characters (changing '1' to '0' or '0' to '1'). The resulting string U should have exactly X humongous subsequences. A humongous subsequence is a subsequence of the form "1010...10" (where "10" is repeated an arbitrary number of times).

The task is to determine the minimum number of flips needed to achieve the desired number of humongous subsequences. If it's not possible to obtain a valid string U, the answer is "NO."

The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, you are given a 10-string S and an integer X. You need to compute the minimum number of flips required to obtain a valid string U with X humongous subsequences, or determine that it's impossible.

Here's an example:
- Test case 1: Given S = "1110" and X = 4. The minimum number of flips needed to obtain a string U with 4 humongous subsequences is 1. Thus, the answer is "YES" followed by the number of flips, which is 1.
- Test case 2: Given S = "110" and X = 1. It's not possible to obtain a valid string U with 1 humongous subsequence. Hence, the answer is "NO."

You need to process multiple queries following the described rules and output the results accordingly.
